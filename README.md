# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of the analysis was to display the UFO data file. Another purpose was to be able to manipulate the data from input filters for easier readability.
## Results
To use the webpage, a user can scroll through the table on the bottom-right side of the page. To filter the data, the user can then type in a constraint into one or more of the input boxes to the left of the table. The constraints will then filter the table automatically.
## Summary
The new design lacks the filter button, which I think would be nice to filter all of the variables at the same time. One thing I would add would be a reset button to remove all of the filters at a given time. It is a lot quicker than going through each box and deleting the filter. Another thing I would add would be a keyword search that can find a specific word or phrase in the comments column.
